### Overview 
The bars module relies on the role definition module. We must define the competency, sub-competency, role, levels, and threshold. 

### User GuideUI Components for BARS (Step by Step)
- On the BARS landing page, you will see an "Add" button that allows you to add new BARS. There is also a search field that includes filters for competency and sub-competency. 
- The page displays a list of BARS, along with their respective competencies, levels, statuses, and available actions. The competency section can be expanded to show any associated sub-competencies. Each sub-competency also includes the same fields for levels, status, and actions.
- The "Levels" represent the Employee Levels defined in the role definition. You can click on the levels to select and add a level. 
- The status of the BARS indicates their progress: if the BARS are fully defined, the status will be "Complete." If they are still being defined, the status will be "Pending."
- For BARS with a "Complete" status, there are three available actions: "View," "Edit," and "Delete." For those marked as "Pending," the action field will indicate that you are continuing to define the BARS.
- Details of Actions page The view details page provides comprehensive information about competencies and sub-competencies, including clearly defined thresholds labelled as poor, fair, and good, along with various level filters. This information is applicable to both the competencies and their associated sub-competencies.
- On the edit page, users have access to a fully elaborated BARS (Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale) page, allowing for detailed editing capabilities.
- Additionally, there is a functionality for deleting defined BARS, enabling users to manage their content effectively.

**Define BARS**
- To define BARS (Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scales), begin by clicking the "ADD" button. This action will direct you to the "Define Bars" page. Here, you'll need to select a competency from those previously added in the role definition. Choose one competency and then click the "Submit" button.
- Upon submitting your selection, a list of thresholds specific to the organization will be displayed. These organizational thresholds, defined for BARS, are essential as they guide managers in assessing employees effectively. Itâ€™s important to meticulously define each threshold for different employee levels to ensure clarity and precision in evaluations.
- To proceed to the next step, click the "Next" button, which will present a form for the subsequent employee levels. This process remains consistent when dealing with sub-competencies. Notably, you will also see a download icon that allows you to auto-fill thresholds from the selected competency. This feature enables you to edit and quickly complete the necessary form fields.
- Once you have filled out the form thoroughly, click the "Submit" button. Your newly added BARS will then appear on the BARS landing page, ready for review and use in employee assessments.
