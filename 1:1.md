### Technical Breakdown
#### rrule
- We are following rrule to schedule recurrence meetings which you can find in OccuranceModal.jsx.
- The RRULE (Recurrence Rule) defines how one-on-one meetings or recurring events are scheduled based on frequency, interval, specific days, and end date.

- RRULE Format:
  ```
  RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL={interval};BYDAY={weekdays};UNTIL={until}
  ```
  - FREQ=WEEKLY → The event repeats weekly.
  - INTERVAL={interval} → Defines how often the event repeats (e.g., every 2 weeks if INTERVAL=2).
  - BYDAY={weekdays} → Specifies the days of the week (e.g., MO,WE,FR for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
  - UNTIL={until} → Defines the end date (in YYYYMMDDT000000Z format).
- Example
  ```
  RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR;UNTIL=20250304T235959Z
  ```
#### How call features works
- **Call Feature Overview**
  - Uses **WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections**.
  - **WebSocket for real-time communication**.
  - Supports **audio/video calls with transcription**.
  - Uses **TURN/STUN servers for NAT traversal** when users are on different networks.
  - If transcription is enabled, **audio is recorded, processed, and converted to text**.

- **Call Initialization**
  1. **User clicks 'Start Meeting'** → A **WebRTC peer connection** is established.
  2. **WebSocket Connection Established** → Handles **session initiation, status updates, and live notifications**.
  3. **TURN/STUN Server Check** → Determines whether **direct P2P is possible or if a relay is needed**.
  4. **Media Permissions Requested** → Browser requests **microphone & camera access**.
  5. **Media Stream Established** → The **user’s video & audio** are initialized.
  6. **Connection Event Handling** → Ensures **both participants receive session updates**.

  - **Code Snippet for WebSocket Initialization**
    ```javascript
    const socket = new WebSocket("wss://yourserver.com/call");
    socket.onopen = () => console.log("WebSocket Connected");
    socket.onmessage = (event) => handleIncomingMessages(event);
    socket.onerror = (error) => console.error("WebSocket Error", error);
    socket.onclose = () => console.log("WebSocket Disconnected");
    ```

- **Media Handling and Peer Connection**
  - Once the call starts, **WebRTC handles media streaming**, and **WebSockets manage call events**.

  - **Media Device Access**
    ```javascript
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })
    .then((stream) => {
        localVideo.srcObject = stream;
        peerConnection.addStream(stream);
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error("Media access error: ", error));
    ```

  - **WebRTC Peer Connection Setup**
    ```javascript
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
        iceServers: [
            { urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
            { urls: "turn:your.turn.server", username: "user", credential: "pass" }
        ]
    });
    ```

- **Handling ICE Candidates**
  ```javascript
  peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
      if (event.candidate) {
          socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "candidate", candidate: event.candidate }));
      }
  };
  ```

- **Call Transcription Handling**\
If transcription is enabled:
  1. **Audio is recorded and sent to the backend.**
  2. **Backend processes and transcribes audio using AI.**
  3. **WebSocket sends live transcription back to the front-end.**

  - **Recording Audio and Sending to Backend**
    ```javascript
    const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
    let audioChunks = [];

    mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
        audioChunks.push(event.data);
    };

    mediaRecorder.onstop = () => {
        const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunks, { type: "audio/wav" });
        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append("audio", audioBlob);
        
        fetch("https://yourserver.com/transcribe", {
            method: "POST",
            body: formData
        }).then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => displayTranscription(data.text));
    };
    ```

  - **Receiving Transcription Data via WebSocket**
    ```javascript
    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        if (data.type === "transcription") {
            displayTranscription(data.text);
        }
    };
    ```

- **Call Termination**
  1. **User clicks 'End Call'**.
  2. **Peer connection is closed**.
  3. **Media tracks are stopped to release system resources**.
  4. **WebSocket sends termination event to the other participant**.
  5. **The session moves to 'Previous Meetings'**.

  - **Code Snippet for Ending a Call**
    ```javascript
    function endCall() {
        peerConnection.close();
        stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
        socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "call-ended" }));
    }
    ```

- **Error Handling and Debugging**
  - **WebSocket Failure Handling** → If disconnected, it attempts to reconnect.
  - **TURN Server Requirement** → If direct connection fails, a relay is used.
  - **Audio/Video Permission Errors** → The UI displays an error if access is denied.
  - **Transcription API Failures** → Retries sending recorded audio if the first attempt fails.
